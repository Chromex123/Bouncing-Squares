A simple project I decided to make to understand the basic aspects of game development.

<b> Game Description: </b> <br>
Squares are bouncing everywhere, but don't let them touch you!

Use the WAD/Arrow keys to control the red square and aim to survive for as long as possible while avoiding the black squares. More squares will spawn as time passes, but don't worry, you can acquire powerups to aid your survival.

Dodge bouncing squares, get powerups, and use your skill to aim for the highest score in this basic but fun game!

<b> Some Things to Note </b>

- The first bouncing square cannot be affected by some powerups (its color is slightly different from the other squares)

- Powerups will begin spawning at 20 seconds and despawn after 5 seconds


- When your score gets high enough, squares will begin spawning faster

- Switching tabs will result in an automatic game over
