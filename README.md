A simple project I created to understand the basic aspects of game development, including collision detection and physics simulation. <br>

<b> Game Description: </b> <br>
Squares are bouncing everywhere, but don't let them touch you!

Use the WAD/Arrow keys to control the red square and aim to survive for as long as possible while avoiding the black squares. More squares will spawn as time passes, but don't worry, you can acquire power-ups to aid your survival.

Dodge bouncing squares, get power-ups, and use your skill to aim for the highest score in this basic but fun game! Can you beat my high score?

<b> Pacman Power-up </b> <br>
Your square will begin flickering yellow, indicating invincibility and the ability to eat enemy squares! Touching an enemy square will cause it to shrink in size. Touch a square three times to make it disappear!

<b> DivideBy2 Power-up </b> <br>

<b> Time Slow/Stop Power-up </b> <br>
Time Slow: The screen will turn blue and enemy squares will move slower, making them easier to avoid. Adds a "charge" to the power-up.

Time Stop: Bonus effect that activates if the power-up has been charged. Instead of slowing down enemies, they will be stopped in place and your score will increase by 5. Resets the power-ups charge.

<b> Some Things to Note </b>

- The first bouncing square cannot be affected by some power-ups (its color is slightly different from the other squares)

- Power-ups will begin spawning at 20 seconds and despawn after 5 seconds


- When your score gets high enough, squares will begin spawning faster

- Switching tabs will result in an automatic game over
